# ConedaKOR

ConedaKOR is a web based application which allows you to store arbitrary
documents and interconnect them with relationships. You can build huge semantic
networks for an unlimited amount of domains. This integrates a sophisticated
ontology management tool with an easy to use media database.

## Features

* Instead of filling countless lists with your metadata, shape it as
  **entities** within a graph ... never repeat yourself!
* Add **relationships** between your entities
* A carefully designed user interface
* Upload any kind of **media** (pictures, video, spreadsheets, …), also many at
  a time
* Images and videos are automatically converted for playback on the web
* Define which **kind** of entities can be related by what **relations**
* Put your entities in one or many **groups** and share them with other users
* A Fine-grained permission system with **user groups** and entity
  **collections**
* Easy extension of the schema for every kind of entity: Add fields for all
  entities of a specific kind or occasionally add data to arbitrary entities
* Tagging with autocomplete and sensible permissions
* Full text search through all your metadata
* A rich API facilitating additional frontends and data harvesting
* Excel import and export
* Deliver one-click zip downloads to your users
* Identify isolated entities
* Merge entities to further normalize your data
* External authentication (for example LDAP) by simple shell scripts
* Easy identifier management and resolution
* Many configurable aspects (welcome page, terms of use, help, primary
  relations, brand, …)
* Access data via an OAI-PMH interface
* Vagrant dev environment
* good unit and integration test coverage
* checked for security problems with
  [brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman)

  ontology (including a convenient OWL import tool)
