    # Add more mappings here.
    # Here is an example that pulls values out of the Regexp:
    #
    #  when /the (notice|error|info) flash/
    #    ".flash.#{$1}"

    # You can also return an array to use a different selector
    # type, like:
    #
    #  when /the header/
    #    [:xpath, "//header"]

    # This allows you to provide a quoted selector as the scope
    # for "within" steps as was previously the default for the
    # web steps:
    when /^the first relation on the page$/
      [:css, ".relation"]
    when /"(.+)"/

      raise "Can't find mapping from \"#{locator}\" to a selector.\n" +
