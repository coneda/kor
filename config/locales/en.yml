    terms_query: |
      To search for parts of a word, add * to the beginning or end of the term:
      <code>*zone</code> or <code>quali*</code> or <code>*vita*</code>
      Terms are combined with AND unless you combine them with OR. To search for
      a phrase, use quotes like this:
      <code>"the gray fox jumps"</code>
      To exclude terms, use NOT:
      <code>mona AND NOT lisa</code>
      AND, OR and NOT are case sensitive. You can also group
      terms and expressions with parentheses:
      <code>(mona AND lisa) OR giocondo</code>
      If you'd like to know more, have a look at the
      <a

      To search for parts of a word, add * to the beginning or end of the term:
      <code>*zone</code> or <code>quali*</code> or <code>*vita*</code>
    dating_query: |
      Use single dates, date ranges or art history expressions (German only)
      like:
      <code>1792</code> or
      <code>1789 bis 1792</code> or
      <code>18. Jahrhundert</code> or
      <code>ca. 1800</code> or
      <code>nach 1792</code>
    file_size_query: |
      Prefix the amount with '+' to find all media with a file size
      larger than the given amount of bytes or with '-' to find smaller
      files. Add KB, MB, GB, or TB to change the unit. Some examples:
      <code>+50MB<br />-100KB<br />+1GB</code>
    no_name_input: |
      Every entity except media needs a unique name. For objects with the same
      name in real life, add a short explanation to "Distinguished name" so that
      both fields are together unique. If an object doesn't have a name, specify
      the reason here, e.g. with "name is unavailable"
    date_input: Use format YYYY-MM-DD
    synonym_input: Provide one synonym per line, for example
      <code>Leo<br />Leonardo<br />Leonardo da Vinci</code>
    property_input: |
      Enter one of more lines using the format "label: value", for example
      <code>width: 100cm<br />height: 120cm</code>Url values are rendered as
      links
