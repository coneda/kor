* help texts can now be translated to German
* the front page can now be fully customized with textile

  is available

## Version 4.1.0

This is a minor feature release. For details on the many bugfixes and new
features, please have a look at the
[milestone summary](https://github.com/coneda/kor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av4.1.0+is%3Aclosed+).
Here are a few highlights:

* entities can now be resolved by medium id (#350)
* the page "new-media" can now be renamed (#348)
* the collection selector is now hidden from the search form for users without
  editing permissions (#303)
* the emitted IIIF manifests are now fully configurable, e.g. to generate
  collection-style manifests combining multiple entites (#302)
* custom fields can now have a customized help text (#297)
* custom fields can now be flagged "mandatory" (#296)
* the order of custom fields can now be configured (#83)

## Version 4.0.1

This is just a bugfix release, for details see the [milestone summary](https://github.com/coneda/kor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av4.0.1+is%3Aclosed).

* dropping angularjs previously prompted using riotjs for rendering custom
  generators. The latter did actually not perform all required operations (e.g.
  conditionals), therefore [EJS](https://ejs.co) is now used. This also
  separates the concern of user templates from general rendering by other code.
  However, this means that the syntax has to be changed once more:
  ~~~html
  <span if={entity.dataset.gnd_id}>{entity.dataset.gnd_id}</span>
  ~~~
  becomes
  ~~~html
  <% if (entity.dataset.gnd_id) { %>
    <span><%= entity.dataset.gnd_id %></span>
  <% } %>
  ~~~

## Version 4.0.0

### User

This is a major release with many bug fixes, new features and some removed
features. For all the details please refer to the
[milestone summary](https://github.com/coneda/kor/milestone/9?closed=1). Here
are some highlights:

* the elasticsearch query_string syntax is now available to users via the
  "Terms" field
* changing permissions for all personal collections has been dropped in favor
  of more fine grained control
* the JSON api is finished
* deployment configuration is now handled entirely by environment variables
  (or .env files) while behavior can now be changed with the web interface
* users can't specify their start page anymore
* option to add custom css has been changed to require a url. Hosting of the
  file is now the user's responsibility.
* removed the widgets functionality from the documentation: The frontend is now
  uniformly implemented as widgets but they are not standalone. This requires
  more work to become a feature.
* given the facilitated install and configuration process, VirtualBox vms are
  not built anymore for every release. They can still be built and the scripts
  will be maintained
* angularjs was dropped in favor of riotjs. As a result generator directives
  have to be changed to use the new syntax, e.g.
  ~~~html
  <span ng-if="entity.dataset.gnd_id">{{entity.dataset.gnd_id}}</span>
  ~~~
  becomes
  ~~~html
  <span if={entity.dataset.gnd_id}>{entity.dataset.gnd_id}</span>
  ~~~

## Internal

* the web frontend is now fully migrated to riot.js.
* db sessions and exception logs have been removed along with their respective
